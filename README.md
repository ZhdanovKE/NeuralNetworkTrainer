# NeuralNetworkTrainer
Model neural network and perform training on numerical samples.

The project contains Java classes for representing:
1) Neural network;
2) Neuron activation function;

and performing:
1) Neural network response evaluation;
2) Training samples normalization;
3) Neural network training in a serapare thread with the Scaled Conjugate Gradients method.
